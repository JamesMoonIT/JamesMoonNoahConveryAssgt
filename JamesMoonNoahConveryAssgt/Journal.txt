- Created Forms
	- GroanHome
	- GroanRules
	- GroanGame
-Updates
	- Created textboxes, labels and trackbar on GroanHome
	- Added navigation to buttons btnStart, btnRules and btnClose
	- Added rules to form GroanRules
Comments: James introduced Noah to Git and set up a repository of the game files. We established a basic design
			of what GroanHome and GroanRules would work like. We also established workload we were going to work with
			and how to approach each step of the assignment.

- Created Classes
	- Dice.cs
	- Game.cs
	- Player.cs
- Edited Forms
	- GroanGame
	- GroanRules
- Updates:
	- We created Game and Session classes to keep track of active game data such as player total wins, current player score,
		as well as knowing what a player rolled and how its results are affected. We also used the class People to store
		the players name and score for easier referability in Session and GroanGame.
	- James reused some code from his last INFT2012 Assignment in 2020. This included the basic functionality and classes
		of Sessions, Game and Dice. Player is mostly untouched as its variables are no different to 2020 INFT2012 Assignment 2.
	- James added psuedo code to Game and Dice, and coded Player to store player name and score, and created getters and setters.
		The psuedo code was a series of methods that would be needed later in the assessment.
	- Noah modified the GroanGame and GroanRules style and behind code for navigation and readability for general player accessibility.
Comments: [IMPORTANT NOTE] James's repo from INFT2012 2020 assignment is public due to his teammate graduating and needing it for his programming
			profile. An effort to mask likeliness is applied to this assignemnt to show I am still familiar with how to code an 
			assignment such as this, and I can work around different assignemnt specifications. The coding style is similar
			as it is simply how I structure my code in all assignments other than INFT2012. The repo can be found
			here: https://github.com/KarlKFoley/Inft2012-SixOfOne

- Edited Classes
	- Dice.cs
	- Game.cs
	- Session.cs
- Updates:
	- James edited the Dice, Game and Session so they work together with each other in storing and retrieving player and game data.
	- James connected the Session to GroanGame and GroanHome so data is stored when btnStart is clicked.
	- Noah made up new designs for GroanGame and added object layout to the form including picture boxes, labels, textboxes and 
		added navigation inside GroanGame.

Comments: The plan today was to add functionality to Sessions and Game, and link them up to GroanGame and GroanHome. As the majority
			of work was evaluating and improving old code, Noah  couldn't do alot coding wise until we had something working. The
			plan for next week is getting the graphics and code behind for them working properly so we can actually start working
			on the visual representation than just the code.
